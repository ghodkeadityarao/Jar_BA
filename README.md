C. Analysis

Top-Performing Category:

- The best-performing category is Clothing, which has strong sales revenue and a good profit margin (4.13%).
- Performance Reason: Clothing could be performing well due to better cost management, pricing strategy, or stronger demand.

Under-Performing Category:

- Electronics and Furniture are both underperforming due to their negative profit margins.
- Electronics: Despite the high sales, the category has a negative profit margin.
- Furniture: This category has the lowest profit margin of all.

Part 2: Target Achievement Analysis

Analysis:

- The MoM change is mostly constant, fluctuating between 0.87% and 1.88%.
- July 2018 (1.88%), November 2018 (1.80%), and March 2019 (1.72%) saw the highest target growth rates.
- The increase in target in July can be due to the premonsoon season or start of academic season (funitures by educational institutions).
- Rise in November can be because of the festive season in that particular month.
- In March, it might be possible due to any sale or offer provided by the furniture company. But we can look into the past year's data too to get an ideal insight for this.

Stratergies:

- Offer special discounts during a high-growth period.
- Increase targets and inventory 2-3 months before high demand periods.
- Use historical data from past data to find monthly targets.
- Ensure fast shipping and easy returns to prevent stockouts.

Part 3: Regional Performance Insights

Observations:
- Madhya Pradesh has the highest order count (101) and strong average profit (₹16.32 per order).
- Maharashtra follows with 90 orders and the highest average profit (₹21.29 per order).
- Rajasthan has 32 orders but maintains a good average profit (₹16.98 per order).
- Gujarat shows low average profit (₹5.34 per order) despite sales being close to Rajasthan.
- Punjab has the lowest total sales (₹16,786) and negative profit.

Conclusion:
- Since Maharashtra and MP have high demand, we can increase the availability of the products.
- In Rajasthan, we can improve the customer base and spread more information about the products.
- Gujarat numbers are similar to Rajasthan, but the average profit is less in Gujarat, so we can make changes in cost/prices.
- Punjab needs immediate actions. We can experiment with different mixes of products or do thorough research about the other vendors there.

Regions to be prioritized:
- Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Punjab require immediate strategies to reduce losses. Most states have a lower order count and negative profit.
- Goa, Nagaland, and Sikkim can be improved through better outreach, promotion, and offers.
